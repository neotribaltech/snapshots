# Enspiral

[Enspiral](http://www.enspiral.com) is a network that started in Wellington New Zealand, they're a community that also make businesses and software.

Organisation within Enspiral is a combination of online and offline.

We meet in person, do informal or project based real-time comms on slack, deep deliberation and decision making on Loomio, and coordination and tracking of actions using Google apps (email, cal, docs, spreashsheet, forms), and Trello (task tracking)

We use a lot of facilitation skills to guide online and offline patterns. e.g. :
